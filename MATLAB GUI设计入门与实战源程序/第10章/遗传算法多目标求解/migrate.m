function state = migrate(FitnessFcn,GenomeLength,options,state )
%MIGRATE Migrate members between sub-populations.
%   state = migrate(FitnessFcn,GenomeLength,options,state ); migrates individuals between
%   subpopulations.
%
%   migrationInterval: If the population size property is a vector
%   of scalars, then there will be multiple, independent populations,
%   evolving separately. Every so often, the best individuals
%   from one sub-population will replace the worst individuals in
%   another sub-population. The migration interval controls how
%   many generation pass between migration. If migrationInterval
%   equals 20, for example, migration between subpopulations will
%   take place every 20 generations.
%
%   migrationFraction: When migration occurs between sub-populations
%   this parameter controls how many individuals move between
%   populations. This is the fraction of the lesser of the two populations
%   that moves. If members are migrating from a sub-population
%   of 50 individuals into a population of 100 individuals and the
%   migrationFraction is 0.1, then 5 individuals (0.1 * 50) will move.
%   Individuals that migrate from one sub-population to another are copied. 
%   They are not removed from the source sub-population.
%
%   migrationDirection: Migration can take place in one direction or two.
%   If migration direction is set to "forward" then migration takes place
%   toward the last sub-population. That is the nth sub-population
%   migrates into the (n+1)'th sub-population. If migration direction is
%   both then the nth sub-population migrates into both the (n-1)th
%   and the (n+1)th sub-population. Migration wraps at the ends of
%   the sup-populations. That is, the last sub-population migrates
%   into the first, and the first may migrate into the last. To prevent
%   wrapping, specify a sub-population of size zero.
